# Web Risk Samples


## Description
This folder has projects to demostrate how to use different APIs of Web Risk in different languages 

What is Web Risk
Web Risk is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. 

The Lookup API lets your client applications check if a URL is included on any of the Web Risk lists.

The Update API lets your client applications download hashed versions of the Web Risk lists for storage in a local or in-memory database. URLs can then be checked locally. 

The Web Risk's Extended Coverage API helps to improve the coverage of malicious urls with a small amount (less than 10%) of potential false positives.

The Evaluate API to let your client applications evaluate the maliciousness of a URL. 

The Submission URLs lets your submit the URL that you suspect are unsafe to Safe Browsing for analysis, and asynchronously check the results of these submissions.
